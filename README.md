My take on the classic arcade racing game. Click START and overtake the cars. Each overtake brings 1 point. The game gradually speeds up. The goal is to stay in traffic as long as possible, avoiding crashes and traffic violations. But don't worry, you won't get a speeding ticket. Crashes and driving in the opposite direction end the game. Stick to your side. 

Controls:
Steering: LEFT, RIGHT
Speed Boost On: UP
Speed Boost Off: DOWN
