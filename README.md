My take on the classic arcade racing game. Click START and overtake the cars. Each overtake brings 1 point. The game gradually speeds up. The goal is to stay in traffic as long as possible, avoiding crashes and traffic violations. But don't worry, you won't get a speeding ticket. Crashes and driving in the opposite direction end the game. Stick to your side.

Controls:
Steering: LEFT, RIGHT
Speed Boost On: UP
Speed Boost Off: DOWN

EDIT: There is an unexpected bug in Game SDK that wasn't there at the time of
development (VS 2013). Just download the bin/debug folder and click on DR!VE.exe to play.
I plan to sort that out, and maybe rewrite the whole game.. Please excuse the variable names and comments in Croatian, that will be fixed as well.
